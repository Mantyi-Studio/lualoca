# Params file
It's intended to set params of every language (font, type (left/right...):
```json
{
	"en": {
		"name": "English"
		"font": "european",
		"pivot": "left"
	}
}
```
If you try to set a language that has no params, you'll get an error. So if you don't want set any params, you can just write `true`:
```json
{
	"en": true
}
```
